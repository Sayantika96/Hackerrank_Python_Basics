Task:

You are given a string.
Your task is to find out if the string  contains: alphanumeric characters, alphabetical characters, digits, lowercase and uppercase characters.

Solve:

s = input()
    print(any(i.isalnum() for i in s))
    print(any(i.isalpha() for i in s))
    print(any(i.isdigit() for i in s))
    print(any(i.islower() for i in s))
    print(any(i.isupper() for i in s))


Steps Used in solving the problem -
Step 1: First s will take input.
Step 2: then we used “any” to check whether the given conditions are true or false. In this, 
we also used five different functions to check different properties with a for loop.
