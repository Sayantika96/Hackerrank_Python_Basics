# Problem:

Write a Python code that takes a user's full name as input and prints their initials in uppercase. 
For example, if the input is "Tom Cruise‚Äù, the program should output "TC."

# Solution:

full_name = input("Enter your name: ")
name = full_name.split()

initials = ""

for i in name:
    initials += i[0].upper()
    
print(initials)
