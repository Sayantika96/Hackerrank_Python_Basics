# Problem:
Write a Python code that asks the user to enter their name and then prints a greeting message that includes their name. 
For example, if the user enters "Jordan", the program should print "Hello, Jordan!"

# Solution:

def get_user_input(name):
     while True:
        try:
            user_input = str(input(name))
            return user_input
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
            print("Invalid input!!! Please try again.")
        
user_name = get_user_input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello!! {user_name}, good morning")
